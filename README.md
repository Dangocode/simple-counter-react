Hello, this is my first attempt at making something with React app: a click counter!

I followed a guide online and managed to make it work in the first try, also added some light css.

Things to work on in the short term:
  - Making it so the "warning" wraps on the next line
  - Getting to high numbers moves the buttons, I need to find a way to make the buttons stick in place and keep the text readable
  - Probably many other things that I will notice once I'm more used to it!
